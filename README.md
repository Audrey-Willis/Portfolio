This site was made using create-react-app--use-npm and styled using styled-components.

It's single page and everything can be accessed by scrolling down or hitting the button on the nav that will take you down to that section using id's.

The resume button on the nav downloads a pdf version of my resume.

It includes three break points and is fully responsive. The gif's on the project section were optimized and turned into webm videos to speed up the site.
