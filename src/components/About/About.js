              My name is Audrey Willis. I'm a semi-young woman living in eastern
              Tennessee with my fiance and three great danes. I love challenges
              and puzzles. My favorite feeling in the world is the sense of
              accomplishment one feels when they've been struggling with a
              problem and have finally gotten to their eureka moment.
              More than anything, I'm a lover of life-long learning. I don't
              consider it a day well spent unless I've expanded my mind in some
              way. I'm eager to benefit from the knowledge of more senior
              developers in the workplace. I hope to always be better than I was
              the day before.
            </p>
