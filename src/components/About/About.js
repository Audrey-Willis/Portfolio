        <p>My name is Audrey Willis. I'm a semi-young woman living in eastern Tennessee with my fiance and three great danes.</p>
        <p>I love challenges and puzzles. My favorite feeling in the world is the sense of accomplishment one feels when they've been struggling with a problem and have finally gotten to their eureka moment. </p>
        <p>More than anything, I'm a lover of life-long learning. I don't consider it a day well spent unless I've expanded my mind in some way. I'm eager to benefit from the knowledge of more senior developers in the workplace. I hope to always be better than I was the day before. </p>
